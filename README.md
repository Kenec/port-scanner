There are 65,535 total TCP Ports and 65,535 total UDP Ports in a computer.
"A port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer, thus ranging from 0 to 65535. For TCP, port number 0 is reserved and cannot be used, while for UDP, the source port is optional and a value of zero means no port. " - [-wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking))
